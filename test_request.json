Do you feel any pain or see any blood?\nGreg Jones: No, no, theres no blood... I dont think anythings broken either. Its just... I dont know. I feel a bit all over the place, to be honest. Cant really remember how I ended up down here.\nJulie Peaterson: Alright, thats good to hear theres no immediate injuries. But you sound a little off. How long have you been on the floor, Greg?\nGreg Jones: I dont know... maybe 20 minutes? It could be longer. I just my minds a bit fuzzy, cant really think straight right now.\nJulie Peaterson: Hmm, okay. You mentioned this has happened before. Has it been happening often?\nGreg Jones: Yeah, this is the third time... this week. Im just so... so frustrated, Julie. Every time I think Im okay, and then... boom, Im back on the floor."
